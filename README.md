Hello everyone this app is just for changing PS1 terminal linux.
============================

if u want to use it you must have python3 in your GNU/Linux and set permission for run it. 

*** if you haven't got knowledge for setting a permission *** \n
just going to your dir of file and right click and open terminal then use (chmod 0555 ./configurs.py or chmod +x ./configurs.py)

or 

open terminal and cd dir of configurs.py and use (chmod 0555 ./configurs.py or chmod +x ./configurs.py)

thanks. <3
